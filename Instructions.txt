Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
Activate the virtual environment.
With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:
Download the necessary NLTK data
Data-Extraction-and-NLP (Project Folder/)
    MasterDictionary/
    StopWords/
    venv/ (virtual environment)
    input.xlsx (contains URLs and URL IDs)
    main.py (Python script)
    Output.xlsx (output file)
Open a terminal or command prompt in your project folder with the virtual environment activated.
Run the main.py file using the virtual environment's Python interpreter
After the script successfully completes its run, check the "Output.xlsx" file in your project folder to review the computed variables for each URL_ID.
